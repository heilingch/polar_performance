This is a concept how to generate sail crossover charts.

# sail_inventory

this is a dictionary that specifies the operating area of each sail using the following parameters:

* Minimum AWA (awa_min)
* Maximum AWA (awa_max)
* Minimum AWS (aws_min)
* Maximum AWS (aws_max)

# Data generation

Use the polar processor to call the sailing operating area with every 5 TWA and ever 1-5 TWS to calculate:
AWA and AWS for this data point based on the polar data.
Propably dedicated functions need to be added to the polar processor to serve this need.
Store the data in the same format like the polar files.

# Plot generation

How to plot the data using matplotlib? The program could iterate through the matrix and based on the sail configuration decide for each data-point how to "paint" the respective pixel on the chart. Is there a function in matplotlib to generate such "cloud" plots?

Yes, matplotlib is perfectly suited for this. The function you are looking for is pcolormesh or contourf.
pcolormesh is ideal for this use case. It takes a 2D grid of coordinates (your TWS and TWA values) and a corresponding 2D grid of color values.
To generate the color grid, you would iterate through your (AWA, AWS) data. For each point, you check it against your sail_inventory to see which sail(s) can be used. You can assign a numerical ID to each sail (e.g., Jib=1, Code0=2, A2=3). This grid of sail IDs can then be passed to pcolormesh with a colormap to create the final chart.

# Handling Overlapping Sails

A key point to consider is how to handle conditions where multiple sails are suitable (i.e., their AWA/AWS ranges overlap). Your concept implies choosing the "optimum" sail. You could define "optimum" in several ways:

Simple Priority: Create a priority list (e.g., always prefer a non-overlapping sail, or prefer a Code 0 over a Jib if both are possible).
Performance-Based: If you have separate polar files for different sails, you could load them and determine which sail provides the highest boat speed for that specific TWA/TWS, making that the "optimum" choice. Your current structure with main_polar_loaded and has_ref_polar in polar_performance.py shows you've already thought about handling multiple polars.

--> in the chart overlapping sails should be indicated by creating an overlapping color effect in the respective areas. Sometimes I deliverately want to decide to keep a certain sail running (e.g., for simplicity at night), if it is technically "allowed". 
Performance based decision will likely not be possible as dedicated polars are not available. Otherwise I could simple use the change sail function in the routing software which is already able to select sails by performance.

# Summary

Your concept is excellent and requires no major changes. The functions needed to implement it already exist within your polar_processor.py. The next step would be to create a new script or class that orchestrates this process: defining the inventory, running the calculations in a loop, determining the optimal sail for each data point, and finally, generating the plot with matplotlib.
